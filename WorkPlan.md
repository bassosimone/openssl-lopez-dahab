#A brief workplan

# Workplan for part 1 - Implementation of Lopez-Dahab Comb multiplication #

## Step 1 ##

The first operations that needs to be performed regards fetching documentation about the OpenSSL code. In particular, we need to:

  * analyze the OpenSSL code in order to understand which portion of the code needs to be adjusted
  * analyze the OpenSSL code again in order to understand how to write the new code

For this step it could be possible to collaborate by writing together a wiki page, or a scribtek document (that should be written anyway during the preparation of the report).

## Step 2 ##

The second operation is pretty "sequential", so it should be difficult to parallelize it. However, it should be possible to assign this task to one of us while the other one could provide support and perform the step 3 alone. It mainly regards:

  * writing the new multiplication algorithm

## Step 3 ##

This step is, again, sequential, but it should be simple enough to be performed just by the person who haven't had a major role in the step 2. This step involves:

  * developing benchmarks in order to compare the new algorithm to the original version.

## Step 4 ##

The final step obviously regards the preparation of the final report about the performed tasks. This step could be easily parallelized between the two of us: roughly speaking, however, one of us should mainly write about the optimized algorithm, while the other one should discuss about the obtained performances.

This step will be better defined after reaching Step 3
